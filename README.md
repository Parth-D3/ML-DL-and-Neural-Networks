# Neural_Networks-and-DL
This is a repository which contains programs related to Neural Networks implementation and Deep Learning Models. Programming language used is Python.

* # CNN Model On Cats and Dogs Dataset
  <br>This is a model to classify input images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained on 2000 images of cats and dogs each.<br>
  <p>      In this model I learnt how to read images from dataset using opencv,convert the images to array format and resize them for the model. I also implemented the necessary hidden layers for CNN model i.e Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer and Fully-Connnected Layer. After some hyperparameter tuning the maximum accuracy obtained is 92.37%</p>

* # Deep Learning Model On MNIST Dataset
  <br>This is a model to classify hand written digits (0-9).The dataset used is MNIST dataset. Shape of dataset is (42000,785).
  <br>
  <p>In this model, I learnt how to create input layers,hiiden layers and output layers for a neural network. I also learnt about the concept of normalization of data.
  To overcome overfiiting of model on dataset I used the dropout method . Dropout removes a certain number of neurons after each iteration from the hidden layers.
  The maximum accuracy obtained is 96.38%</p>
